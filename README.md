# raspberry_humidity_temp

This project is to create a raspberry pi controller of irrigation of hydroponic green forage of corn seed, it will use humidity and temperature to control irrigation system, also will read from internet another variables like wind and temperature of the CR state to take decisions about when to irrigate. 

Also this data will be storage in a data base for further analysis using ML to improves the system. 

Sensors:

* DHT11: controls temperature and humidity on the shelf 
* Kuman soil moisture module (K70): controls the humidity of the corn in the tray.

Data momentarily will be store in google sheets
